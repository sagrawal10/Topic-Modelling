Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation

Purpose:
The notebook "Latent Dirichlet Allocation.ipynb" discusses the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) unsupervised learning algorithm which is used for topic analysis in text data. It first assumes all documents in the text corpus consists of a mixture of a finite number of topics, and each topic is another mixture of similar words. Given this assumption, LDA uses bayesian inference to back out the distribution of topics and their associated words.
